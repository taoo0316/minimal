Hi! Welcome to my page! 

This page lists each course I took in College and one key takeaway.

#### YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1

> I am not as bad in literature as I think I am. I do not like reading as much as I think do.

#### YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1

> Reading translated texts can be a real pain.

#### YCC1121 Comparative Social Inquiry

> Opinions about social issues tend to be drawn from personal encounters.

#### YCC1122 Quantitative Reasoning

> Programming seems to be about following the right syntax, which will later turn out to be a huge mistake.
