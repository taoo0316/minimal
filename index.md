Hi! Welcome to my page! 

This page lists each course I took in college and one key takeaway.

#### YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1

> Reading translated texts can be a real pain.

#### YCC1121 Comparative Social Inquiry

> Opinions about social issues tend to be drawn from personal encounters.

#### YCC1122 Quantitative Reasoning

> Programming seems to be about following the right syntax, which will later turn out to be a huge mistake.

#### edX and Summer School

> Online classes are really not the best.

#### YCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2

> I actually love literature and overanalysing a piece of text.

> Modelling in R is so fun!

#### YSC1216 Calculus

> You can never learn calculus too many times.

#### YSC1212 Introduction to Computer Science

> Programming is a serious endeavour that requires great care.

#### YSC2209 Proof
